## Donation Store Minecraft
This is the official repo for the Donation Store (Java Based) Minecraft plugins. As of now the following servers are
supported:

- Spigot
- Bungeecord
- Sponge

Compared to the previous version of the plugin, it has been completely rewritten and modularised, so, where possible,
most of the functionality that is common across all the above plugins is in the common library.

#### Download
You can view the source code here, you can download it and build it yourself. If you would like a pre built version of
the plugin, you can download it from our website, or you can view our daily builds on Jenkins.

#### Support
If you would support with any of the code here or with your installation or license with Donation Store, please do not
use GitHub issues, contact us on our website.

#### Contribution & Pull Requests
If you want to contribute to this plugin, go ahead! We would love to see what you add. Fork the repo and open a PR
when you want. It will be reviewed whenever we have the chance by a developer. Please note that while Donation Store game
plugins are open source, the core Donation Store application is a product, meaning that this plugin (while not sold with the
main application), is needed to fulfill the abilities of the core app. By your PR being merged you agree to give us a
perpetual, royalty free irrevocable to use and relicense the code and even sell it on under any terms. 

##### Contribution Notes
Any pull requests that are opened must follow the following criteria in order to be considered for merging:

- The code will be analysed by Sonar. You can install Sonar Lint on IntelliJ. Use it before you submit.
- Any code added must have >= 90% unit test code coverage or else it will not be considered.
